# 6502_Fart_Bombs
6502 Fart Bombs is a Microsoft Minesweeper like game

To download the game, look for the prg in the release folder.

The name is just being funny, but when I started it, I wanted to channel that 13 year old kid that wanted to write a game instead of just keying in stuff from books and magazines.
