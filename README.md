# 6502_Fart_Bombs
6502 Fart Bombs is a Microsoft Minesweeper like game

To download the game, look for the prg in the release folder.

The name is just being funny, but when I started it, I wanted to channel that 13 year old kid that wanted to write a game instead of just keying in stuff from books and magazines.

The program is written in Prog8 using IntelliJ on a Mac. So to compile you will need the Prog8 tool chain on whatever OS you choose. However, the Makefile included in this repository may require editing based on your OS and setup.
